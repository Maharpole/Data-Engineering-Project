#### 1. **Database Design**
   - **Technology**: Oracle Autonomous Database (or Oracle MySQL).
   - **Description**: 
     - Use Oracle Autonomous Database to store sales data across multiple tables (e.g., orders, customers, products, and payments).
     - Set up **primary** and **foreign keys** to establish relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Store historical sales transactions and customer details.
     - Use Oracle’s built-in features such as automatic backups and tuning.
### **Database Ideation:**

#### 2. **Data Storage**
   - **Technology**: **OCI Object Storage** and **OCI Data Lakehouse**.
   - **Description**:
     - Store raw sales data (e.g., CSV or JSON files) in **OCI Object Storage** as your data lake.
     - Store structured and processed data in **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** for querying and reporting.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Utilize OCI's scalability for object storage to handle large volumes of raw data.
     - Use ADW for high-performance data analytics.

#### 3. **Data Pipeline**
   - **Technology**: **OCI Data Integration** or custom solution using **OCI Functions** and **Oracle Cloud Shell** for pipeline orchestration.
   - **Description**:
     - Design an ETL pipeline using **OCI Data Integration** to extract data from OCI Object Storage, transform it (e.g., clean sales data, enrich with customer data), and load it into Oracle Autonomous Database.
     - For real-time processing, use **OCI Functions** to trigger transformations and load data based on events like new file uploads to Object Storage.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Leverage built-in connectors to simplify the ETL process.
     - Optimize the pipeline to scale dynamically with data size.

#### 4. **Automation**
   - **Technology**: **OCI Functions**, **OCI Events**, and **OCI Scheduled Jobs**.
   - **Description**:
     - Use **OCI Functions** to automate ETL tasks based on event triggers (e.g., new sales data being uploaded to Object Storage).
     - Use **OCI Scheduled Jobs** to run the pipeline at regular intervals (e.g., nightly sales data updates).
   - **Key Features**:
     - Serverless automation using **OCI Functions** to avoid managing infrastructure.
     - Schedule data processing tasks using OCI's native job scheduler.

#### 5. **IAM Permissions & Security**
   - **Technology**: **OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.
   - **Description**:
     - Define granular IAM policies using **OCI IAM** to restrict access to sensitive data and services.
     - Set up roles and policies to ensure the ETL pipeline has the correct permissions to access Object Storage, Autonomous Database, and other OCI services.
     - Ensure data security by using encryption for data at rest and in transit.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Utilize OCI’s **Vault** for securely managing sensitive information such as database credentials.
     - Enforce principle of least privilege for all resources.

#### 6. **Team Development**
   - **Technology**: **OCI DevOps** for version control, continuous integration, and code reviews.
   - **Description**:
     - Use **OCI DevOps** pipelines for automating deployment and testing of your data pipeline and other components.
     - Collaborate using Git (integrated into OCI DevOps), manage tasks via Agile boards (e.g., Jira), and conduct peer code reviews.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Use **OCI DevOps Projects** for continuous integration and deployment.
     - Implement automated testing for your ETL pipeline and database schema updates.

---

### **Final Deliverables**:
- **Autonomous Database schema** with related tables (orders, customers, products, payments).
- **Data stored in OCI Object Storage** as raw files and **Autonomous Data Warehouse** for structured, queryable data.
- **ETL pipeline** automated using **OCI Data Integration** and **OCI Functions**, storing data into the database.
- **IAM roles and policies** ensuring secure access to the pipeline, storage, and database.
- **Team collaboration** using **OCI DevOps** for version control, automation, and code reviews.
